# Fast-Laundries-Mobile-App

The Fast Laundries app plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the proposed Laundry delivery service.
It provides users with a convenient platform for locating, reserving,
and managing laundry logistics. Here's an overview of how the app works:

1. Registration and Account Creation:
Users need to download the Bird app from their device's app store (available for iOS and Android)
create an account. This typically involves providing basic information such as a phone number,
 email address, and payment details.

2. Locating Nearby Laundries:

After creating an account and logging in, 
users can open the app to see a map displaying the locations of nearby Laundries. 
The app uses GPS to determine the user's location and shows scooter availability in their vicinity.



3. Tracking Ride Progress:

Throughout the pickup and dropoff, the app keeps track of important information, 
including the duration of the ride and the distance traveled. 
This data is used to calculate the ride's cost. The laundry charges is also factored in.

4. Billing and Payment:

The app handles the billing process, charging users based on the duration of their invoice
can link their preferred payment methods, such as credit cards or mobile wallets,
to their Bird account for seamless transactions.

5. Account Management:

Users can manage their account settings, view laundry history, and access support 
and customer service through the app. They can also review their past orders and payment transactions.

6. Security and Identity

7. Features in the works
We look forward to incorporating Laundromat support features.
